## Overview

App Academy January Cohort 2023

This was my first project that I ever created. It was split into two parts where for one week, I created the backend portion of the app using Express.js/Node.js and another week where I created the frontend portion using React/Redux.

I decided to base my theme around a childhood game I used to play called "MapleStory". As you browse, storybnb, check out maps that exist around the game, create your own spot to rent out and add reviews to others!
